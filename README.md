# ST2195-Data-programming-FYP

This project consists of 5 questions that is based on the Harvard Dataverse of flight arrival and departure details of all commercial flights with the USA. 
In this report, we focus on the data from the years 2000 and 2001, this project is also prepared using both Python and R programming environment. 
For every question, we first begin our working with python and then move towards the working with R. 
The first question examines us to find the best time of the day, week and year to minimise delays, where we filter two data frames from the original data frame based. 
Then use bar plot to visualize the distribution of on-time flights. 
The second question asks us to check if the older planes suffer from more delays, we merged with plane-data on tail number, and delay times are calculated for each flight.
Then proportion of delayed flights by year is calculated the third question examines about the number of people flying between different locations change over time. 
We intend to find the top 15 most repeated origin and destination airports for 2000 and 2001 found and further interpretation is given in the report.
For fourth question, we try to produce the same scatter plot using python and R language which shows a positive relationship between departure delay and arrival delay in the year 2000. 
For the final question we need to make use of the available variables and built a model to predict delays. 
This question is about preparing a model, and we aimed to construct a linear regression model. 
We start by showing the correlation between the different columns of the data, extract the prediction variables, splits the dataset into training and testing sets, fits a linear regression model, and make predictions on the test set. 
It also calculates the mean squared error and R-squared using the predicted and actual values from the linear regression model.
